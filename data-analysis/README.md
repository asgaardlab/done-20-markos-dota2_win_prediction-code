# Data analysis

The data manipulation code (such as *feature_engineering.ipynb*) dependents on the raw dataset (match files in the json format), which are available [here](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3890315).

The other source code files (in the *prediction-models/* and *prediction-explanation-SHAP/* directories) only depend on the computed features, which are readily-available in the *prediction-models/model_features_pre-match/* directory.
